  "about_text1": "Hello, we are Maria and Lewis, a couple of creatives from Mallorca.",
  "about_text2": "What we do is simple (well, not that simple): we design what connects your brand or company with your audience or customers. There are a lot of details on that, and we consider them all.",
  "about_text3": "For example, the correct application of a typeface or color, the number of clicks on a website to achieve something or how fast loads, or the combination of all that (a beautiful logo is useless if the website is slow and hard to use) influence the perception that people have of a brand. And we want to make it as positive as possible.",
  "about_text4": "To achieve that we start studying your needs and circumstances, in order to create a strategy about which to design and build the necessary elements with the latest technologies and tools (no shabby templates or ugly logos downloaded from the internet). All we do is original, from the first stroke of a logo to the last line of code of a website.",
  "about_text5": "Our way of work is based on collaboration: we know about our stuff, you know about your stuff, so we join and we know the double. Not a bad start, but to do it right we need communication and sincerity. We are not going to propose a solution if we don't fully believe in it. And if we can't offer anything, we'll tell you.",
